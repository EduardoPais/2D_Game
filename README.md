# 2D Game (Work in Progress)

A Java project where Iâ€™m learning game development by creating a **Metroidvania-style 2D platformer**.  
The project is still in an early stage of development.

---

## About

The goal of this project is to build a side-scrolling game inspired by Hollow Knight and other Metroidvania titles.  
Right now, it has the basics of movement, collision, and rendering, but more features will be added over time.

---

## Current Features

- Basic game loop  
- Player movement with keyboard controls  
- Collision with map tiles and objects  
- Rendering of sprites and backgrounds  

---

## Planned Features

- Platforming mechanics (jumping, double jump, wall climb, dash)  
- Enemies with simple AI  
- Health and damage system  
- Collectibles / power-ups  
- Map exploration with locked areas (Metroidvania style)  
- Sound and background music  
- Menus (start screen, pause, game over)
